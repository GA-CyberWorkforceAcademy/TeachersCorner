Operating Systems
=================

Operating Systems run computers, servers and appliances used is our lives
everyday. Understanding how software and hardware work together to meet their
intended purposes provides a foundation about how digital devices contribute to
our world. Operating Systems should cover Windows and \*Nix systems
(POSIX-based, such as UNIX, Linux, FreeBSD…).

**Sample Skill**: Comparing and Contrasting the way Windows and Linux operating
systems are used, administered or secured.

Networking
==========

Networking provides an understanding of how computers and digital systems
connect, communicate or provide, use and share resources. This includes an
understanding on network devices, protocols and connections. Networking should
also look at what is considered the “transport” of information. This includes
topics like fiber optics, satellite and wireless communications and Ethernet.

**Sample Skill**: Discovering relationships between levels and types of internet
access/connectivity and other societal indicators such as GDP, political
structures and standards of living.

Programming
===========

Programming involves using a computer language to define a set of instructions
to perform. A programmer creates things through the use of the scientific method
and technological tools. Programming fundamentals can be learned in any
language, but starting with an easy to learn language helps. Python and Ruby are
great starter languages.

**Sample Skill**: Analyzing math or science related equations and creating a
computer program to produce expected results for a given situation.

Security Fundamentals
=====================

Security fundamentals spans a wide range of topics, from not technical to highly
technical. This area should include vocabulary, types of threats and threat
actors, ethics, the human psychological elements in cyber, and methodologies for
both offensive and defensive mindsets. Understanding the offensive mindset is
critical for providing the best defense against attacks.

**Sample Skill**: Identifying and evaluating the strength of control measures
used to mitigate threats to a computer system.

Technology in Society
=====================

Understanding and synthetizing all the elements of technology that shape and
touch our lives is important across academic disciplines as well as in our
day-to-day lives. The rapid evolution of society has been shaped by technology,
but technology is also shaping our society. This area should seek to explore the
ways that cyber is relevant to different areas of our world and what the
potential benefits and considerations are as technology is developed and
integrated into society.

**Sample Skill**: Understanding the role that social media plays in the world
and

how it relates to public opinion, information sharing, misinformation, politics
and conflict.
