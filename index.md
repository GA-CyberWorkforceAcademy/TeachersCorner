**Introduction**
======

The term “cyber” is difficult for many to define. Some would say that it means
the internet; others would default to cybersecurity or hacking as the meaning of
“cyber”. We like to use the definition of cyber that defines it as the people,
processed and technology. Through this lens, it is clear to see that cyber
touches everyone’s lives, often on a daily basis. Cyber is a critical domain;
cyber education is imperative to ensure our youth can navigate the world we live
in. Furthermore, careers across numerous sectors require skills from the cyber
domain. Equipping students in these skills is essential to their ability to
succeed.

In K12 education, computer science is an existing offering but this does not
fully encompass all the components of cyber. When we consider the need to
incorporate cyber into K12 education as a challenge with *MANY* solutions. Some
schools may choose to offer a CTAE pathway in cybersecurity, or another
information technology based area. Fortunately, a school that cannot support, or
does not have interest in using a CTAE pathway (or other stand-alone cyber
course) can still offer cyber education. In this way, we can enable a broad
subsection of educators to ensure that students are receiving critical knowledge
skills and abilities in cyber regardless of their participating in a Computer
Science course, or a CTAE pathway.

Through incorporating concepts and skills that are applicable to cyber
throughout core curriculum topics, a school can enhance their existing
curriculum while further improving the education and preparation of their
students. We believe this innovative method can be implemented in any school
that is willing. Incorporating cyber concepts and skills into core curriculum
requires passion and motivation but with resources, guides, and suggested
project based learning assignments, teachers should be able to work towards
incorporating cyber into their programs organically.

**What are Cyber Skills?**
======

The skills needed within the realm of “cyber” can be broken down into the
following broad categories:

-   *Operating Systems*

-   *Networking*

-   *Computer Programming*

-   *Technology in Society*

-   *Security Fundamentals*

___

## **Operating Systems**

Operating Systems run computers, servers and appliances
used is our lives every day. Understanding how software and hardware work
together to meet their intended purposes provides a foundation about how digital
devices contribute to our world.
